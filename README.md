Weâ€™ve created an AI service for emergencies. It uses info from authorities to provide key protocols and info to citizens via SMS or web app, offering a solution without internet.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that can help improve the response and management of emergency situations, such as natural or human disasters. AI can analyze large amounts of data, such as satellite images, weather data or social data, to predict risks, assess damage and provide useful information to citizens and rescue teams. AI can also facilitate communication between authorities and people affected by an emergency, offering solutions without the need for internet.

Maverick REACT offers artificial intelligence integration for emergency situations. Our service uses AI with the necessary event information provided by government officials and acts as an assistant to provide key protocols and information to citizens. The AI service is accessed via SMS or web portal, offering a solution without internet.

How does our service work? When an emergency situation occurs, such as a flood, fire or earthquake, our service sends an SMS message or makes a voice call to numbers registered in a database or the citizen can contact a number provided by the authorities. The message or call contains information about the type and severity of the emergency, preventive measures that should be taken and resources available in the area. The user can respond to the message or call with specific questions about their personal situation or request additional help. Our service uses AI algorithms to process responses and offer personalized and updated advice.

REACT has several advantages over traditional emergency alert and response systems. Firstly, it does not depend on the internet, which means it can function even when there are power outages or problems with mobile networks. Secondly, REACT service is interactive and adaptable to the individual needs of each user. Thirdly, it uses reliable and verified sources of information provided by the government or other authorized organizations. And finally REACT is fast and efficient in sending and receiving large-scale messages or calls.

Our goal is to contribute to creating a safer and more resilient world in the face of emergency situations through innovative and intelligent use of technology. We believe that our service can save lives and reduce suffering caused by disasters. If you want to know more about our service or how to register for it, contact us. We are Maverick AI.
